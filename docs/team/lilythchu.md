# Overview
ModQuik is a desktop app for NUS CS Professors, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
It allows the professors to keep track of their students, teaching assistants and timetable for their courses.

## Summary of contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [lilythchu's tP Dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=lilythchu&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
    * Added the ability to add and delete tutorials.
        * What it does: Allows the user to add and delete any tutorials they might have.
        * Justification: This feature makes our product more attractive as users would usually want to keep track of tutorials that they are teaching.
        * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing command as it was similar to the `add`, `edit` and `delete` commands that AddressBook already has.
          Thus, there was a need to abstract out similar components and adhere to the DRY principle.
    * Added the ability to switch between different contents within the app.
        * What it does: Allows the user to switch between student, tutorial, consultation and grade chart by typing command.
        * Justification: This feature makes our product more optimal for fast-typists.

* **Project management**: to be added soon

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added screenshots for the following features:
            * `mark reminder`
            * `switch f/grade`
    * Developer Guide:
        * to be added soon

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**: to be added soon

* **Review/mentoring contributions**: to be added soon
