# Overview
ModQuik is a desktop app for NUS CS Professors, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
It allows the professors to keep track of their students, teaching assistants and timetable for their courses.

## Summary of contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [LimAiLin's tP Dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=LimAiLin&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * Added the ability to add, edit and delete students.
      * What it does: Allows the user to add, edit and delete any students from the student list.
      * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing command as it was similar to the `add`, `edit` and `delete` commands that AddressBook already has.
        Thus, there was a need to abstract out similar components and adhere to the DRY principle.
  * Added additional fields and modified existing fields of Student.
      * `StudentId`
      * `Phone`
      * `TelegramHandle`
      * `Grade`
      * `Attendance`
      * `Participation`
  * Added the ability to mark and unmark reminders.
      * What it does: Allows the user to mark their reminder as done, or unmark their reminder as undone.
      * Justification: This feature makes our product more attractive as users can visualise which tasks they have done or are yet to be done.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Organised the structure and outline
        * Added documentation for the following sections:
          * `Navigating the User Guide`
          * `Navigating the GUI`
          * `Add Student Feature`
        * Added documentation for the following features:
